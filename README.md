My negative feelings toward the A&M administration has been slowly growing the longer I attend the university. I have found that the administration has put money over well being of the students and for most of these things I have to deal wit but in this instance I can make a difference. What has in this instance should be illegal as it is anti-capitalism. There is a website myEDU that allows students to see the grades of their professors and has great tools like custom schedule making and job opportunities using their profiles. Overall, a better site than the garbage alternative that A&M is now forcing the students to use. I won't mention it because I don't even want to give them web traffic. It's silly having to spend $5,500 a year on tuition and then spend more money just so I can take a good professor because that is what college is all about. You can put the brightest student in a hard class with a terrible professor and they may make an A but at what cost? The hours they have to spend teaching themselves how to do the work because they want the A? Isn't that such a silly concept? We pay the school just so we can spend most of our time learning the degree ourselves. Ridiculous. 

A&M continues to show that money is more important to them than the actual students. From keeping freshman on campus, to expanding the size of the campus even though the CITY's infrastructure, let alone the college's, can't handle it, to limiting the amount of transfer credits a student can bring in, and probably others that I can't think of that others can. Like I said I can't do much but I can help out in this aspect. I can bet you anything that A&M is getting a cut of the money from the silly website. The most ironic thing is at the bottom is states "Made by the Students, For the students."

What irony.
